# Bioprinting GCode Tool (Java Edition)

A terminal-based tool I developed to parametrically generate GCode files for the Cellink BioX 3D printer. 
Existing slicers did not have sufficient precision or customization of different print properties for research
purposes so I simply made my own. 

This version is "complete" and will not be further updated. I am revamping the entire program to be GUI-based for ease of use but
that takes time and for now I'm shifting focus away from primarily programming so until then, this is the best solution. 


[Download](https://github.com/cjreplogle/BGT-C/tags) - *For now, download BGT-C. Java version isn't compiling how I want it to.*

[Documentation](https://github.com/cjreplogle/BGT/blob/main/help.md) - *If you are confused on any functionality of this program, read this first.*

[Changelog](https://github.com/cjreplogle/BGT/blob/main/changelog.md) - *Update history of this program since its creation, as version control was implemented later in development.*

[BGT-C](https://github.com/cjreplogle/BGT-C/tree/main) - *Old version of this program if you ever need it.*
