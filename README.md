# Bioprinting GCode Tool (Java Edition) 
![BGT Icon](https://github.com/cjreplogle/BGT-J/blob/main/assets/BGT.png)

A terminal-based tool I developed to parametrically generate GCode files for the Cellink BioX 3D printer. 
Existing slicers did not have sufficient precision or customization of different print properties for research
purposes so I simply made my own. 

This version is highly experimental and requires some understanding of how it is programmed and the ability to use a terminal user interface to operate effectively. I am revamping the entire program to be GUI-based for ease of use but
that takes time and for now I'm shifting my focus towards protocol optimization as this program is capable of doing everything necessary for my purposes.
