# Bioprinting GCode Tool

A terminal-based tool I developed to parametrically generate GCode files for the Cellink BioX 3D printer. 
Existing slicers did not have sufficient precision or customization of different print properties for research
purposes so I simply made my own. 

This version is "complete" and will not be further updated. I am revamping the entire program to be GUI-based for ease of use but
that takes time and for now I'm shifting focus away from primarily programming so until then, this is the best solution. 

If there are issues, contact me: replogle.17@buckeyemail.osu.edu
